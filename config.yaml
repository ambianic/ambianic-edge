# Masks allow filtering out input signal before an AI model sees it

  # svg mask applies an SVG graphics onto an input image
#  svg: ambianic.masks.SvgMask
#    arguments:
#      - uri # of the svg file
      # scale_to_fit indicates whether to scale the mask to fit the stream source shape

#      - scale_to_fit
  # audio_hz_trim is a simple mask that cuts out frequency ranges from an input audio stream
  # audio_hz_trim: ambian.masks.AudioHzTrim
  #  arguments:
  #    - hz_band # lower and upper frequency range to cut out

# print a heartbeat message to the log
